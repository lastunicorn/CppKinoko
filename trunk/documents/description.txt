CppKinoko v1.0
==============

There are two projects in the solution at the moment:
	- CppKinoko - the framework
	- CppKinoko.Example - an example of how the framework can be used.


1) Project: CppKinoko
---------------------
Contains the two classes:
	- Kinoko - This class does the measurement and returns the calculated average.
	- KinokoResult - Stores the results of the measurements and calculates the average.


2) Project CppKinoko.Example
----------------------------
It is a console application that instanciates the Kinoko class, gives it a function to measure and displays the results.


3) Future features
------------------
	- Create a console application that can take as parameter a dll and a function name and measure it.
